  The Content Insight Tool is a system that I built for Hub. It retrieves data from videos of different social media and
  shows them in a dashboard. There you can compare videos from different brands, social media platforms and periods of
  time.
</p>

<p>The tool consists of different modules:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Dashboard</strong>: A Vue application that is based around the Quasar framework. The charts are built using
    ECharts.
  </li>

  <li><strong>Backend</strong>: A Node.js Express server. It uses Sequelize to connect to a Postgres database.</li>

  <li>
    <strong>Data Fetching Tool</strong>: A Node.js server that connects to several social media APIs to update the
    videos of the system. The API calls are cached on a MongoDB database.
  </li>
</ul>
