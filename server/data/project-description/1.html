  The Content Insight Tool is a system that extracts data from videos of different social media and presents them in a
  dashboard. There you can compare videos from different brands, social media platforms and periods of time. Some of the
  insights are generated through machine learning.

  The platform is a complex project that started before I joined Hub, around 2018, but I was involved during all my time
  at the company. I was in charge of developing the modules that would retrieve the data, send it to the machine
  learning module (written in Python) and store it in a database to finally show it in the dashboard.
</p>

<p>Each module was built using different range of technologies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Dashboard</strong>: A Vue application that is based around the Quasar framework. The charts were built using
    ECharts.
  </li>

  <li><strong>Backend</strong>: A Node.js Express server. It connects to a Postgres database using Sequelize.</li>

  <li>
    <strong>Data Fetching Tool</strong>: A Node.js server that connects to several social media APIs to update the
    videos of the system. The API calls are cached on a MongoDB database.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  This was a very exciting project, as it touched a varied range of technologies, and it played a significant role in my
  growth as a developer.
