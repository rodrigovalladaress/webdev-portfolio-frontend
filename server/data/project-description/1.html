  The Content Insight Tool is a complex system that was started a bit before I joined Hub, around 2018. Basically, it
  retrieves data from videos of different social media and shows them in a dashboard. There you can compare videos from
  different brands, social media platforms and periods of time. Apart from that, it used machine learning to generate
  insights about the videos.

  I was in charge of the modules of the system that would retrieve the data, send it to the machine learning module
  (written in Python) and store it in a database to finally show it in the dashboard.
</p>

<p>Each module used different technologies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Dashboard</strong>: A Vue application that is based around the Quasar framework. The charts are built using
    ECharts.
  </li>

  <li><strong>Backend</strong>: A Node.js Express server. It uses Sequelize to connect to a Postgres database.</li>

  <li>
    <strong>Data Fetching Tool</strong>: A Node.js server that connects to several social media APIs to update the
    videos of the system. The API calls are cached on a MongoDB database.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  This was a very exciting project, as it touched a varied range of technologies, and it helped me quite a lot to grow
  as a developer.
