<p>Ahamo was a webapp that let people save notes of an event.</p>

<p>
  Basically, attendants added notes to a timestamp during a live event (or an on-demand video after the event has
  finished). The note hold the timestamp information, so it was possible to know when the users added it.
</p>

<p>
  The notes were also public, and the application showed a graph with the number of notes on each timestamp, so it was a
  great way of knowing which part of the event was the most interesting.
</p>

<p>The notes could hold different data:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Text</li>

  <li>Images</li>

  <li>Audio</li>

  <li>Video</li>
</ul>

<p>
  The backend of the application was a Go server. The frontend was based on React, and used Chart.js to build the note
  charts.
