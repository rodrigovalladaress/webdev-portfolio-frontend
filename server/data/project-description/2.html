  Ahamo was a Hub’s webapp that was designed for capturing and saving notes during an event. I collaborated with a
  coworker to build it around 2019.
</p>

<p>
  Participants added notes during a live event (or an on-demand video after the event has finished). The note held the
  timestamp data, so it provided valuable information for the system. For example, the application showed a graph with
  the number of notes on each timestamp, so it was a great way of identifying the highlights of the event.
</p>

<p>
  The backend of the application was a Go server. The frontend was React-based, and Chart.js was used to build the note
  charts.
</p>

<p>
  This was a really interesting project, as it was my first time using Go and React. Go was especially difficult, as at
  that point of my career I was more used to dynamic typed languages.

<p>
  Additionally, it was possible to take a photo or record audio or video and attach it to the notes. Figuring out the
  best way to store that kind of data was also challenging.
