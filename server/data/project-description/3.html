  Around the year 2022, Hub was in the process of a new brand refresh. As I was working full-time in the Content Insight
  Tool, this project was assigned to an external agency.

  However, after the development was complete, I was in charge of fixing bugs, updating the style to create new pages
  and finally deploying the site. It was a challenging project, as working with code that I wasn't used to is an added
  layer of complexity.
