  Around the year 2022, Hub was in the process of a new brand refresh. As I was working full-time in the Content Insight
  Tool, this project was outsourced to an external agency. However, when the development was completed, I was
  responsible for fixing bugs and finally deploying the site. After that, I was in charge of managing the site (creating
  new pages, updating the style, adding new functionalities, etc.).

  Sometimes it was a challenging task, as working with code that I wasn't used to was an added layer of complexity.
  However, it was a great project for learning new ways of developing websites on WordPress.
