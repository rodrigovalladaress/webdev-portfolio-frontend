<p>The website was developed around the year 2020, as Hub was in the process of a brand refresh.</p>

  It was developed using WordPress. The theme was built from scratch, so it challenged me to learn more about the
  framework and CSS.

  The forms needed to send the data to Hubspot. The integration with the CRM was an interesting challenge too, as it was
  done through the WordPress REST API.
