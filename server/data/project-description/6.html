  After I finished my job at Hub on 2023, I decided to start courses on different skills that I wanted to learn or
  improve:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>UX/UI design</li>

  <li>Figma</li>

  <li>Three.js</li>

  <li>Shaders</li>
</ul>

<p>The portfolio website that you are looking at now is the result of learning those and other skills:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    First, I designed the portfolio on Figma, so I could have an idea of what I wanted the website to look like. First,
    I created a wireframe to design the site’s flow. After I was satisfied with the result, I started creating the UI
    design.
  </li>

  <li>
    While working on the UI design, one of the ideas was to use Three.js to showcase my skills. For that, I decided to
    create an animation using that library and shaders, and use the result as the background of the website.
  </li>

  <li>
    I always wanted to use a Server Side Rendering framework for Vue, so I used Nuxt for the portfolio. The learning
    curve was steep at first, as you need to relearn a bit how Vue works, but the overall experience was enriching.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  This project was quite interesting, as I had the chance to learn skills that I wanted to learn for a long time. I
  believe that this project has helped me to advance my developer career, providing me with a broader toolset to tackle
  future programming challenges with confidence.
