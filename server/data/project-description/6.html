<p>After I finished my job at Hub, I decided to start courses on different skills that I wanted to learn or improve:</p>

<ul>
  <li>UX/UI design</li>

  <li>Figma</li>

  <li>Three.js</li>

  <li>Shaders</li>
</ul>

<p>The portfolio website is the result of learning those and other skills:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    First, I designed the portfolio on Figma, so I could have an idea of what I wanted the website to look like. First,
    I created a wireframe to design the flow of the site. After I thought it was correct, I created the UI design.
  </li>

  <li>
    During the UI design, I wanted to use Three.js to showcase my skills using the library. So I used it to create an
    animation for the background of the website. The animation uses a shader, so it's more performant.
  </li>

  <li>
    I always wanted to use a Server Side Rendering framework for Vue, so I used Nuxt for the portfolio. The learning
    curve was a bit steep at first, as you need to relearn a bit how to use Vue, but it was a great experience at the
    end.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  This project was really interesting, as I had the chance to learn skills that I wanted to learn for a long time. I
  believe this project has helped me to improve my developer career.
