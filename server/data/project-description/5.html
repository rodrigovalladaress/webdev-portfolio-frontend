  Around the year 2020, Hub and Bombora were in the process of a brand refresh, so this website was developed to align
  to the new guidelines.

  The Bombora website project was similar to the Hub 2020 rebranding: it was developed using WordPress and the theme was
  built from scratch. It also helped me to learn more about the framework and CSS.
